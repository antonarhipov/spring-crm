3. Input validation and sanitization
4. Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
5. SSL/TLS encryption for all communications

### Performance Requirements
1. Response time < 500ms for 95% of requests
2. Support for concurrent users
3. Efficient database queries
4. Proper caching implementation

### Integration Requirements
